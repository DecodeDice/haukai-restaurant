            <h1>Welcome to Haukai Restaurant</h1>
            <p>At Haukai, we not only serve delicious food but also invite you to experience Te Ao Māori, where every meal is blessed with traditional karakia, reflecting the deep connection between food, culture, and community. Our restaurant embraces the rich heritage of Aotearoa, offering a dining experience that goes beyond the plate. Every dish is crafted with care, using locally sourced ingredients that honor the land and the people who nurture it.</p>
            <p>We take pride in sharing the stories behind our dishes, from the humble rewena bread to the flavors of paua and kumara, all of which hold special meaning in Māori cuisine. Whether you're a local or a visitor, you'll find that Haukai is more than just a place to eat—it's a place to connect with the past and present of Māori culture, to learn about the traditions that have shaped our way of life, and to be part of a welcoming community that values the importance of hospitality, or manaakitanga.</p>
            <p>Join us for a meal that nourishes both body and spirit, in a setting that invites you to slow down and appreciate the beauty of the Bay of Islands. From the moment you step through our doors, you are part of our whānau, and we are honored to share the richness of our heritage with you.</p>
